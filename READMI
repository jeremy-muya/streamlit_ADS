Hotel Booking Prediction App
This Streamlit web application uses a Random Forest model to predict hotel booking cancellations based on user input. Additionally, the application provides visualizations and insights into the dataset.

How to Use
1. Upload Your Dataset
You can upload your own dataset in CSV format using the "Upload a CSV file" button. If you don't have a file to upload, the application will use the default dataset ("hotel_bookings.csv").

2. Explore the Dataset
Once the dataset is loaded, the application displays a preview of the dataset's first few rows.

3. Visualizations
- Stays and Adults Comparison
This bar chart compares stays in weeknights, stays in weekend nights, and the number of adults.
- Arrival Date and Guest Comparison
This box plot visualizes the comparison of arrival date month, adults, and whether the guest is a repeat guest.
- Arrival Month and Adults Comparison
This bar chart shows the comparison of arrival month and adults.

4. User Input for Prediction
On the sidebar, you can enter specific parameters for prediction:
- Stays in Week Nights: Number of stays in week nights.
- Stays in Weekend Nights: Number of stays in weekend nights.
- Adults: Number of adults.
- Arrival Date Month: Month of arrival.
After entering the parameters for each feature, click the "Done" button to proceed.

5. Model Prediction
The application will display the prediction result based on the provided user input.

6. Training the Model
The application is backed by a Random Forest model trained on the provided dataset.
The training code preprocesses the data, handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, splits the data, and trains the Random Forest model.
The best model is saved and can be loaded for making predictions.

Files
Hotel_training.py: Python script containing the training code.
